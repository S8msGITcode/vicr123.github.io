Quiet Mode allows you to focus on your work without any notifications and sounds disturbing you.

# Quiet Modes
There are currently three Quiet Modes available:
- **Sound**

  Allows all sounds from all app, and notifications from all apps. This is the default.
- **No Notifications**

  Ignores any notifications from all apps, except those set to bypass Quiet Mode. Normal sounds will still be played, and timers and reminders will still notify you, however, they won't play any sounds.
- **Mute**

  Completely turns off all sounds and notifications from all apps, including those set to bypass Quiet Mode. Not even timers or reminders will notify you.
