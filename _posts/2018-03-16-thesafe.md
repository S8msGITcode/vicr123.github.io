Hey everyone,

I've created a new backup tool called theSafe.<!-- end_excerpt --> It uses the `bup` program to actually perform the backups, and will run silently in the background.

Configuring and monitoring theSafe is easy with the configuration tool being made to be simple to use.

![theSafe Configuration]({{ "/blogAssets/thesafe.png" | absolute_url }})

You can get the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/vicr123/theSafe).

As always, theSafe is available in the AUR and in my custom repository as a prebuilt binary package for those of you using Arch Linux (or a derivative)

Thanks,<br />
Victor :)
